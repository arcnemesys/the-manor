<h1>Holy Grail Projects</h1>
<p>
 While talking to my younger brother, he said off-handedly that he knew I'd been thinking deeply about an idea, that for me, would be my life's work, but he referred to it as my <strong>Holy Grail Project</strong>, and that phrase so accurately captures how much the project means to me, that it has become a meta-<i>North Star</i>, if you will.</p>
		<p>
			The project (which I'll give a brief overview of later), is a North Star, something that guides and orients me in life- however I believe one can have many North Stars: what makes a North Star a Holy Grail Project is that it is something that the best version of you would be willing to suffer for, and pour your very living essence into.
		</p>
<p>
			We all have things that we're driven towards, and drawn to, over most others, but I would ask you to oblige me in a small thought experiment, and consider what of those things for you, would the <i>best</i> version of you be willing to suffer for, and pour ones lifeblood into?
		</p>
<p>
			If nothing in that list of things meets this criteria, that's fine, as they can still be productive, enriching, nourishing to the soul, worthy of time, effort and resource expenditure, however perhaps reflect on the degree to which they really are, to you, and reclibrate the values accordingly.
		</p>
<p>As well, take some time to contemplate, soul search, and meditate, on what a project that meets this criteria for you would be? Are there any ideas that come to mind? It could be that the endeavor that satisfies these criteria intimidates you, which is perfectly fine, in some ways, it should to some degree.</p>
<p>While I don't think everyone <i>must</i> have a Holy Grail Project, I think, if you can identify one, that you shouldn't shy away from it, because there's something within you that wants to achieve something outsized, and more importantly wants you to be the best version of you, while doing so.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with having multiple Holy Grail Projects either, Elon has at least three: multi-planetary civilization, AI, and freedom of speech/anti-censorship.</p>

<p>So, let's do a quick recap of what constitutes a Holy Grail Project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
				It requires you to become the best version of you.
			</li>
			<li>The best version of you must be willing to suffer to complete it.</li>
			<li>
				It demands that you pour the essence of yourself into it, and you must find it worthy of having that demand met.
			</li>
		</ul>

<p>I'd like to add one more condition, or property rather, which I think is the most important:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It must outlive you.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The reasoning behind this last condition is, if the <i>best</i> version of you is going to sacrifice a meaningful amount of the limited time you have here, and your very essence, it should, much like the actual Holy Grail, be something that people value, seek out, and desire, long after you're gone.</p>
<p>There's no way to know if that will be so, unless your successful Holy Grail Project is conquering death itself, in which case this condition no longer matters because no one will die, or at least, no one will remain dead. Though on the other hand, it still counts because that would certainly be something that would be valued long after what was once the normative lifespan.</p>
		<p>Also, it doesn't have to be at the scale of making civilization space-faring, it could be something commonplace, such as raising children, which, while commonplace, is nonetheless a priceless, noble, and inestimably meaningful endeavor to undertake.</p>

<p>Below, you'll find a short overview of my Holy Grail Project, <strong>ArtRiver</strong>.</p>

            <h2>The Dilemma of Audio: Many Versions, No Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Version control is not at all a new concept for iterative endeavors, having been used in industrial manufacturing and design, before it was ported to the domain of programming.
                </p>
                <p>However, given the meteoric rise of complex software, it has become genericized, with the star player being git. In less than a century from the genesis of the field, programming has effectively solved the issue of version control.
                </p>
                <p>
                Now, it is time for the creative domain to evolve, and adopt version control, as a integral part of its existence.

                A quick look around the internet will make it clear that the creative domain, has not progressed beyond First-generation version control, simply saving file names with appended and incremented series of numbers, and sharing work by emailing files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While that may work for individual local projects, it's inefficient, unwieldy, and makes collaboration painful, providing no way to way to synchronize changes, and combine work done on various parts of creative projects.
                    It offers no utility in the way back-ups, leading to a common problem in, for example, the music industry, where files are lost forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008, a fire at Universal Studios Hollywood destroyed roughly one to two hundred thousand master recordings, belonging to iconic artists and bands like <strong>Elton John</strong>, <strong>Nirvana</strong>, <strong>Janet Jackson</strong>, <strong>Niel Diamond</strong>, <strong>Aerosmith</strong>, <strong>Aretha Franklin</strong>, <strong>Ray Charles</strong>, <strong>Lynyrd Skynyrd</strong> and <strong>Slayer</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Lucian Grainge, the CEO of Universal Music Group said in response to the event that "...<em>the loss of even a single piece of archived material is heartbreaking</em>."</p>
                <p>He's correct.</p>
                <p>ArtRiver exists to make it so that none of these problems afflict the creative process any longer. No one, from the humble hobbyists, to the greatest artists of our time, and times gone by, should lose entire pieces of artwork, due to freak accidents, and human error.</p>
                <p>In an era where the creation of art is highly technological, and iconic art from the analog era becomes digitized, version control, which is so pivotal in creating the tools for making and translating art to a new medium, has a powerful and necessary role to play.</p>
        </article>

<h2>May We All Meander More</h2>
<article class="region prose wrapper hero">
      <p>
        ArtRiver is a distributed version control system for musicians, that will allow artists to track and navigate the
        various branches and possibilities a creative work went through, on the
        way to completion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Artriver exists to allow artists to draw from a granular record of the
        various tweaks and changes they make to various pieces of art, by
        coalescing these creative excursions in various directions into a
        navigable digital construct.
      </p>

      <p> Artists can avoid the worry of accidental deletions, not just of whole
      works, but of parts of versions of works, and the like. From another
      perspective, it offers a new methodology to hone their craft, pin-pointing
      the mixing or synthesizer settings that didn't resonate, blossom fully,
      or highlight those that put the art on the path to becoming a finished product. </p> 
      
      <p> The creative process, rather than culminating in this point, can in fact
      have a life beyond it.</p>

      <h2>What Makes ArtRiver Run</h2>
      <ul>


        <section>

          <h3>The ArtRiver.</h3>
          <p>
            Every creative project is an ArtRiver, which will exist locally.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

          <h3>The Timeshore.</h3>
          <p>
            For each ArtRiver project, there is an associated Timeshore, a metadata focused data structure
            that will chronicle major and minor changes, and save points, throughout
            the lifetime of an ArtRiver.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

          <h3>The Glacier.</h3>
          <p>
            Once a change to an ArtRiver project is finalized, it will be preserved in the Glacier, a data construct which mirrors
            an ArtRiver, and applies changes from the Timeshore. It is analagous to a remote, and allows for collaboration and
            synchronization/distribution of changes to ArtRiver project.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>

          <h3>The Iceberg.</h3>
          <p>
            Once a change has been preserved in a Glacier, it will be stored in the Iceberg, a compressed replica of the project and it's history.
            It is a last resort redunancy solution, for extreme situations where remotes become corrupted or destroyed, and provides a preservation mechanism
			for master recordings of the great works of media, as they become digitized, remastered, etc.
