<h2>Holy Grail Projects</h2>
<p>
 While talking to my younger brother, he said off-handedly that he knew I'd been thinking deeply about an idea, that for me, would be my life's work, but he referred to it as my <strong>Holy Grail Project</strong>, and that phrase so accurately captures how much the project means to me, that it has become a meta-<i>North Star</i>, if you will.</p>
		<p>
			The project (which I'll give a brief overview of later), is a North Star, something that guides and orients me in life- however I believe one can have many North Stars: what makes a North Star a Holy Grail Project is that it is something that the best version of you would be willing to suffer for, and pour your very living essence into.
		</p>
<p>
			We all have things that we're driven towards, and drawn to, over most others, but I would ask you to oblige me in a small thought experiment, and consider what of those things for you, would the <i>best</i> version of you be willing to suffer for, and pour ones lifeblood into?
		</p>
<p>
			If nothing in that list of things meets this criteria, that's fine, as they can still be productive, enriching, nourishing to the soul, worthy of time, effort and resource expenditure, however perhaps reflect on the degree to which they really are, to you, and reclibrate the values accordingly.
		</p>
<p>As well, take some time to contemplate, soul search, and meditate, on what a project that meets this criteria for you would be? Are there any ideas that come to mind? It could be that the endeavor that satisfies these criteria intimidates you, which is perfectly fine, in some ways, it should to some degree.</p>
<p>While I don't think everyone <i>must</i> have a Holy Grail Project, I think, if you can identify one, that you shouldn't shy away from it, because there's something within you that wants to achieve something outsized, and more importantly wants you to be the best version of you, while doing so.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with having multiple Holy Grail Projects either, Elon has at least three: multi-planetary civilization, AI, and freedom of speech/anti-censorship.</p>

<p>So, let's do a quick recap of what constitutes a Holy Grail Project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
				It requires you to become the best version of you.
			</li>
			<li>The best version of you must be willing to suffer to complete it.</li>
			<li>
				It demands that you pour the essence of yourself into it, and you must find it worthy of having that demand met.
			</li>
		</ul>

<p>I'd like to add one more condition, or property rather, which I think is the most important:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It must outlive you.</li>
		</ul>
<p>The reasoning behind this last condition is, if the <i>best</i> version of you is going to sacrifice a meaningful amount of the limited time you have here, and your very essence, it should, much like the actual Holy Grail, be something that people value, seek out, and desire, long after you're gone.</p>
<p>There's no way to know if that will be so, unless your successful Holy Grail Project is conquering death itself, in which case this condition no longer matters because no one will die, or at least, no one will remain dead. Though on the other hand, it still counts because that would certainly be something that would be valued long after what was once the normative lifespan.</p>
		<p>Also, it doesn't have to be at the scale of making civilization space-faring, it could be something commonplace, such as raising children, which, while commonplace, is nonetheless a priceless, noble, and inestimably meaningful endeavor to undertake.</p>

<p>For me, my Holy Grail Project is <strong>ArtRiver</strong>.</p>
